Donald Trump, the Arab Spring, Brexit: digital media have provided
political actors and citizens with new tools to engage in politics.
These tools are now routinely used by activists, candidates,
non-governmental organizations, and parties to inform, mobilize, and
persuade people. But what are the effects of this retooling of
politics? Do digital media empower the powerless or are they breaking
democracy? Have these new tools and practices fundamentally changed
politics or is their impact just a matter of degree? This clear-eyed
guide steps back from hyperbolic hopes and fears to offer a balanced
account of what aspects of politics are being shaped by digital media
and what remains unchanged.

<!-- ## Praise for the book -->


<!-- Jungherr, Rivero and Gayo-Avello’s Retooling Politics is simply -->
<!-- exquisite. By all means this book represents one of the finest -->
<!-- accounts I have come across to explain why and how digital media is -->
<!-- the largest and most profound transformative power in today’s -->
<!-- democracy. With a comprehensive, meticulous, and sharp use of the most -->
<!-- current and influential literature in the social sciences, the authors -->
<!-- build a brilliant and multi-disciplinary argument that will guide -->
<!-- readers to better grasp how digital media has transformed our -->
<!-- political realm. Homero Gil de Zúñiga, University of Vienna -->

<!-- Retooling Politics is simply the best book I have read on politics in -->
<!-- the digital age. The authors show how political actors use legacy -->
<!-- media, digital platforms, and data driven strategies to change how -->
<!-- public information is produced, distributed, received, evaluated and -->
<!-- used. This book updates the entire field with a timely focus on -->
<!-- contemporary problems of democracy. It is destined to become a -->
<!-- classic. W. Lance Bennett, University of Washington  -->

<!-- Retooling Politics offers a fresh and nuanced ‘needs-based’ framework -->
<!-- for analyzing the effects of digital media on political life. This is -->
<!-- a necessary book that cuts through hyperbole in its grounded, -->
<!-- procedural analysis of what has actually changed in politics, from how -->
<!-- organizations pursue their ends to the voices that count in public -->
<!-- life. Daniel Kreiss, UNC Center for Information, Technology, and -->
<!-- Public Life -->

<!-- The effects of digital media on politics and democracy are -->
<!-- far-reaching, diverse, quickly evolving, and difficult to grasp. -->
<!-- Retooling Politics is an essential resource for anyone trying to make -->
<!-- sense of the connection between digital media and politics - and to -->
<!-- understand what we actually know about it. Fabrizio Gilardi, -->
<!-- University of Zurich  -->

<!-- All over the world, old political goals are pursued with new political -->
<!-- tools. Retooling Politics’ needs-based approach presents a nuanced new -->
<!-- way of thinking about the impact not on specific political outcomes, -->
<!-- or on the basic goals of political actors, but on the practical and -->
<!-- institutional process of politics. Thus, this book will help combat -->
<!-- the catchy but simplistic narratives advanced by digital cheerleaders -->
<!-- and doom-mongers and contribute to more realistic and evidence-based -->
<!-- alternatives. Rasmus Nielsen, University of Oxford -->


<!-- This book gives a nuanced analysis of digital media in politics, -->
<!-- focusing on political actors’ needs, flows and costs of information, -->
<!-- and connections to publics. The authors offer readers a careful and -->
<!-- systematic approach to the big question of whether digital media -->
<!-- strengthen or undermine democracy. Bruce Bimber, University of -->
<!-- California, Santa Barbara -->
