In 2020, I published my second book [Retooling Politics: How Digital
Media Are Shaping
Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-and-society/retooling-politics-how-digital-media-are-shaping-democracy),
with Andreas Jungherr and Daniel Gayo-Avello. In the book, we use a
needs-based framework to study the flow and reach of political
information, the role of data in politics, and the impact of digital
tools on contestation, political organizations, and democracy at
large.

<blockquote>
Donald Trump, the Arab Spring, Brexit: digital media have provided
political actors and citizens with new tools to engage in politics.
These tools are now routinely used by activists, candidates,
non-governmental organizations, and parties to inform, mobilize, and
persuade people. But what are the effects of this retooling of
politics? Do digital media empower the powerless or are they breaking
democracy? Have these new tools and practices fundamentally changed
politics or is their impact just a matter of degree? This clear-eyed
guide steps back from hyperbolic hopes and fears to offer a balanced
account of what aspects of politics are being shaped by digital media
and what remains unchanged.

### Praise for the book

<div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
<blockquote> <p>Jungherr, Rivero and Gayo-Avello’s Retooling Politics is
simply exquisite. By all means this book represents one of the finest
accounts I have come across to explain why and how digital media is
the largest and most profound transformative power in today’s
democracy. With a comprehensive, meticulous, and sharp use of the most
current and influential literature in the social sciences, the authors
build a brilliant and multi-disciplinary argument that will guide
readers to better grasp how digital media has transformed our
political realm. </p> <footer><em>Homero Gil de Zúñiga,

<div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
<blockquote> <p>Retooling Politics is simply the best book I have read on politics in
the digital age. The authors show how political actors use legacy
media, digital platforms, and data driven strategies to change how
public information is produced, distributed, received, evaluated and
used. This book updates the entire field with a timely focus on
contemporary problems of democracy. It is destined to become a
classic.  </p> <footer><em>W. Lance Bennett, University of Washington</em></footer> </blockquote>

<blockquote> <p>The effects of digital media on politics and democracy are
far-reaching, diverse, quickly evolving, and difficult to grasp.
Retooling Politics is an essential resource for anyone trying to make
sense of the connection between digital media and politics - and to
understand what we actually know about it.  </p> <footer><em>Fabrizio Gilardi,

<div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <blockquote> <p> Retooling
Politics offers a fresh and nuanced ‘needs-based’ framework for
analyzing the effects of digital media on political life. This is a
necessary book that cuts through hyperbole in its grounded, procedural
analysis of what has actually changed in politics, from how
organizations pursue their ends to the voices that count in public
life. </p> <footer><em>Daniel Kreiss, UNC Center for Information,

<div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <blockquote> <p> All over the
world, old political goals are pursued with new political tools.
Retooling Politics’ needs-based approach presents a nuanced new way of
thinking about the impact not on specific political outcomes, or on
the basic goals of political actors, but on the practical and
institutional process of politics. Thus, this book will help combat
the catchy but simplistic narratives advanced by digital cheerleaders
and doom-mongers and contribute to more realistic and evidence-based
alternatives. </p> <footer><em> Rasmus Nielsen, University of Oxford

<div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <blockquote> <p> This book gives a
nuanced analysis of digital media in politics, focusing on political
actors’ needs, flows and costs of information, and connections to
publics. The authors offer readers a careful and systematic approach
to the big question of whether digital media strengthen or undermine
democracy. </p> <footer><em>Bruce Bimber, University of California,
