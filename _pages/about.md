I am a research scientist specialized in the collection and analysis
of digital data for social research and public policy. I often write
about the impact of digital tools on political representation and
about research methodology.

I currently serve as the associate director of [Data
Labs,](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/about-data-labs/) the
computational social research team of [Pew Research
Center](https://www.pewresearch.org). My team uses new methods and
data sources "to generate a foundation of facts that enrich the public
dialogue."

Before joining the Center, I worked as senior data science manager at
[Westat,](https://www.westat.com) a research services company, where I
built machine learning systems to make social data collection more
efficient. I started my career as statistician in the [Scientific
Research Group of
YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/solutions/sectors/political-academic-policy/),
an online opt-in survey panel, in Palo Alto, California. I received my
MA and Ph.D. in Politics from [New York
University](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/page/home).

Originally from Galicia (Spain), I am currently based in Washington,
D.C.
