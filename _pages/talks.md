I frequently engage with specialists and general audiences on areas of
social science, methodology, and technology related to my work and
research. In addition to presentations and keynotes in professional
conferences, I am also regularly quoted as expert in domestic and
international media.

Over the years, I have taught short courses and seminars on methods
and infrastructure in massive data analysis and on different areas of
survey statistics for social scientists.

I am interested in good research and engineering practices and I have
led a number of trainings on computational reproducibility, methods of
software development for statistical programming, and introductory and
