I am a data scientist and social researcher specialized in the design
and development of tools that facilitate the collection of high
quality social data. I use machine learning and statistical models to
build rapid feedback applications and quality control systems, and to
enrich traditional survey data with new digital sources. I often write
about digital politics, computational methodology, and survey
research.

I currently serve as associate director of [Data
Labs,](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/about-data-labs/) the
computational social research team at [Pew Research
Center,](https://www.pewresearch.org) where I co-manage the research
and operations of the team. Our goal is to complement the overall
mission of the organization to "enrich the public dialogue and support
sound decision-making" using new methods and data sources.

Before joining Pew Research Center, I worked as senior data science
manager and principal statistician at
[Westat,](https://www.westat.com) a research services company in
Rockville, MD, where I built machine learning tools to make the
collection of survey data more efficient. At Westat, I also advised
senior leadership on emerging data technologies and on modern
practices in reproducibility. I started my career as statistician in
the [Scientific Research Group of
YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/solutions/sectors/political-academic-policy/),
an online opt-in panel, in Palo Alto, California.

Although I have developed my entire professional career in industry, I
have maintained an active academic profile. I started my career
working on the consequences of factionalism in coercive institutions
for political instability in democracies and autocracies. Recently, I
have become interested in how digital tools impact political
participation and representation.

In 2020, I published my second book [Retooling Politics: How Digital
Media Are Shaping
Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-and-society/retooling-politics-how-digital-media-are-shaping-democracy)
(Cambridge University Press), coauthored with Andreas Jungherr and
Daniel Gayo-Avello. In it, we use a needs-based framework to re-asses
the recent research on the flow and reach of political information,
the role of data in politics, and the impact of digital tools on
constatation, political organizations, and democracy at large.


I received my MA and Ph.D. in Politics from [New York
University](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/page/home). Before that, I
graduated in [Social Sciences](http://www.march.es/ceacs/) (MA) and
[History](http://www.uvigo.es) (BA and MA). Originally from Galicia
(Spain), I am currently based in Washington, D.C. More information can be
