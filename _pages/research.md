I am passionate about research and have maintained an active portfolio
even while working in industry.

Much of my work has dealt with the empirical foundations of political
representation: how [individual
attitudes](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/709672)
translate into [political
behavior](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/rooting-out-corruption-or-rooting-for-corruption-the-heterogeneous-electoral-consequences-of-scandals/902FCB9C6DF2CCB1DB73E57AC07AD5D4)
and how institutional constraints shape decision-making. At the
beginning of my career, I investigated the role of [coercive
institutions](http://ipp.csic.es/en/event/seminarios-cip-oligopoly-violence-civilian-control-heterogeneous-military)
in regime instability. Over time, I have grown interested in the
impact of [digital
tools](https://www.amazon.com/Retooling-Politics-Digital-Shaping-Democracy/dp/1108419402)
on political participation and in the measurement of [political
inequality](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439314558836?journalCode=ssce)
in [online
contexts.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/16/politics-on-twitter-one-third-of-tweets-from-u-s-adults-are-political/)
My current projects explore the relation between geographic
representation and networked participation.


On the methodological side, I am interested in the [application of
machine learning
methods](https://www.westat.com/capability/statistical-sciences/artificial-intelligence-ai-data-analytics)
to improve the quality of [research data collection
systems.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525822X221107053)
In earlier publications, I focused on the development of [statistical
methods](http://libreria.cis.es/libros/analisis-de-datos-incompletos-en-ciencias-sociales/9788474765632/)
for the measurement of political attitudes and behaviors
[online](https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21582041.2017.1325924)
and
[offline.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379415001092)
A theorist at heart, I maintain an active interest in [formal
theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268015000592).

During my career, I have advised statistical institutes, academic
organizations, and agencies on survey data collection, on statistical
methodology, and on open science.
