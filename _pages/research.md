I started my research career working on the consequences of
factionalism in coercive institutions for regime instability. More
recently, I have become interested in the impact of digital tools on
political representation and on the application of machine learning
methods in public policy.

In 2020, I published my second book [Retooling Politics: How Digital
Media Are Shaping
Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-and-society/retooling-politics-how-digital-media-are-shaping-democracy),
with Andreas Jungherr and Daniel Gayo-Avello. In the book, we use a
needs-based framework to study the flow and reach of political
information, the role of data in politics, and the impact of digital
tools on contestation, political organizations, and democracy at
large.
